Quick Start
***********

A quickstart guide which walks new users through building a working
application. This piece is critically important, as it will determine
what new users think of your project. Having a good quickstart guide
shows users that you care for them, and ensures that both you (as a
maintainer) and your users have a good understanding of your project.
