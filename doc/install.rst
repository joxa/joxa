Install
*******

There are two ways to Install Joxa. The first is to simply
drop the Joxa executable in your path. That executable is an
``escript``. An escript is basically a binary executable. However, it
depends on the existence (on your machine) of the Erlang Virtual
Machine. So either install that
`now from source <http://www.erlang.org>`_ or install it from the
packaging system on your distribution.
