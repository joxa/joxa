The Joxa Programing Language
############################

**Joxa is a small semantically clean, functional Lisp**. It is
desgined as a general-purpose language encouraging interactive
development and a functional programming style. Like other Lisps, Joxa
treats code as data and has a full (unhygienic) macro system. Joxa has
an advantage over other Lisp in that it runs on the Erlang Virtual
Machine and inherits all of the benifits for concurrency and
distribution provided by that platform.
