Joxa
====

__Joxa is a small semantically clean, functional lisp__. It is a
general-purpose language encouraging interactive development and a
functional programming style. Joxa runs on the Erlang Virtual
Machine. Like other Lisps, Joxa treats code as data and has a full
(unhygienic) macro system.

Joxa (pronounced 'jocksah') isn't Erlang, though its very
compatible. Its not Clojure though there is plenty of shared
syntax. It's not Common Lisp though that is the source of the macro
system. While Joxa shares elements of many languages, it is its own
specific language.  of all these languages, and knowing these
languages will help you get up to speed with Joxa, but it is its own
unique language.
